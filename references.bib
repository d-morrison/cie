abstract = {CAUSAL INFERENCE IN STATISTICS A Primer Causality is central to the understanding and use of data. Without an understanding of cause–effect relationships, we cannot use data to answer questions as basic as "Does this treatment harm or help patients?" But though hundreds of introductory texts are available on statistical methods of data analysis, until now, no beginner-level book has been written about the exploding arsenal of methods that can tease causal information from data. Causal Inference in Statistics fills that gap. Using simple examples and plain language, the book lays out how to define causal parameters; the assumptions necessary to estimate causal parameters in a variety of situations; how to express those assumptions mathematically; whether those assumptions have testable implications; how to predict the effects of interventions; and how to reason counterfactually. These are the foundational tools that any student of statistics needs to acquire in order to use statistical methods to answer causal questions of interest. This book is accessible to anyone with an interest in interpreting data, from undergraduates, professors, researchers, or to the interested layperson. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of fields, including medicine, public policy, and law; a brief introduction to probability and statistics is provided for the uninitiated; and each chapter comes with study questions to reinforce the readers understanding.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Difference-in-differences (DiD) is a popular observational causal inference method in health policy, employed to evaluate the real-world impact of policies and programs. To estimate treatment effects, DiD relies on a “parallel trends assumption” that treatment and comparison groups would have had parallel trajectories on average in the absence of an intervention. Recent years have seen both growing use of DiD in health policy and medicine and rapid advancements in DiD methods. To support DiD implementation in these fields, this paper reviews and synthesizes best practices and recent innovations. We provide recommendations to practitioners in four areas: (1) assessing causal assumptions; (2) adjusting for covariates and other approaches to relax causal assumptions; (3) accounting for staggered treatment timing; and (4) conducting robust inference, especially when normal-based clustered standard errors are inappropriate. For each, we explain challenges and common pitfalls in traditional DiD and recommend methods to address these. We explore current treatment of these topics through a focused literature review of medical DiD studies.},
