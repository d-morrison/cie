#### potential outcome, consequence

A **potential outcome** of action $a$ 
(also called a **consequence** of $a$)
is the value of a random variable $Y$
that would occur if we were to take action $a$.
The potential outcome of action $a$ on random variable $Y$ 
is often denoted $Y(a)$, $Y^a$, or $Y^{A=a}$.
We will use notation $\po{Y}{a}$.
