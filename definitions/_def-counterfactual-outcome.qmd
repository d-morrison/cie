:::{#def-factual-outcome}

#### Factual outcome, observed outcome

A *factual outcome* (or *observed outcome*)
is the potential outcome
corresponding to an action that was actually taken.
:::

::: notes
If we consider taking action $a$
or an alternative $a'$,
and we actually take action $A=a$,
then $Y(a)$ is the factual outcome.

#### Counterfactual outcome

A counterfactual outcome is a potential outcome
corresponding to an action that was not actually taken.
:::

::: notes

If we consider taking action $a$
or an alternative $a'$,
and we actually take action $A=a$,
then $Y(a')$ is a counterfactual outcome.

There might be more than one counterfactual outcome,
depending on how many action options were considered,
but there can only ever be one factual outcome per random variable.
