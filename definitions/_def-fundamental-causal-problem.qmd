#### Fundamental problem of causal inference

The *fundamental problem of causal inference* is
that only one potential outcome (the factual outcome) can be observed per person
(or per sampling unit, more generally) [@holland1986].
The other, counterfactual outcomes, are all missing data,
and thus, the causal effects are all missing data as well.
