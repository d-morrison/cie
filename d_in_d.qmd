# Difference in differences analyses

Many approaches to causal inference rely on 
conditional exchangeability (@def-cond-exch)
and its consequences (@thm-cond-exch):

$$\thmExch$$

Difference-in-differences makes a weaker assumption:

$$\Expf{Y_t(0) - Y_{t'}(0) | X = 1} = \Expf{Y_t(0) - Y_{t'}(0) | X = 0}$$
