# Introduction to causal inference

## Introduction

@hernan2020causal (page vii): 

> Unfortunately, 
the scientific literature is plagued by studies in which 
the causal question is not explicitly stated 
and the investigators’ unverifiable assumptions are not declared.
This casual attitude towards causal inference 
has led to a great deal of confusion.

::: notes
Rigorously defining cause and effect is difficult.
Fortunately, many humans have strong intuitions about these concepts.
We will make cursory attempts at definitions for the basic terms,
and leave the finer points to philosophers.
